RSS - an efficient RSS reader for Go
======================================

RSS is a library for parsing RSS feeds for the Go language. It's focus is on speed and efficiency, and is not built for robustness. For example, this library does not validate, or even use, XML in any way. Feel free to give it a shot, although it's currently under active development.
